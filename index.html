                            <p>Typically this takes place over Zoom, but if you're in the Ottawa area I can come to you.</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h4>Why pay for a site when I can use a website builder?</h4>
        <p>Website builders can work for some people, but there are some real disadvantages: the three big ones are ongoing costs, customisation, and [learning curve].</p>
        <p>The biggest disadvantage is price: most website builders have costly monthly fees that can add up quickly. I price per project, so you'll always know how much you're paying up front, and it's a one-time fee.</p>
        <p>Most website builders have limited options and have you select a premade style, with limited ways to change it. The websites I make are completely customized to you, so you get exactly what you want - no detail is too small to change.</p>
        <p>There's often a steep learning curve: it can take so long to figure out the software that it costs you more in time than you would have paid for a custom site. Adding extra features like scheduling or online store can get even more complicated, and mistakes can have a real financial impact on your business. And of course, something always seems to go wrong when you need to make an update in a hurry! I offer a retainer option that ensures I'll always have time to make a quick update for you.</p>

        <h4>Do you use templates?</h4>
        <p>That's up to you! Working from a template makes the process faster and cheaper, but I'm happy to design something completely from scratch if that's what you prefer. Any sites created from templates will have a lot of customization, so even if I start from a template, you can still get exactly what you want.</p>

        <h4>What if I change my mind halfway through?</h4>
        <p>Not a problem! Everything will be laid out clearly in the project contract, including what happens if you choose not to complete the project.</p>

        <h4>I have a great idea for a web app! Will you build it?</h4>
        <p>If you pay for it: sure!</p>
        <p>If you want me to work for free, exposure, or equity: nope! None of those will pay my rent.</p>

        <h4>Do you offer discounts?</h4>
        <p>Typically, no.</p>
        <p>However, depending on your business, I may be open to an exchange of goods or services instead of paying with money. (This is at my discretion and entirely depends on my personal interests.)</p>

        <h4>I'm sick of Zoom calls! Can I hire you by email instead of talking on a call?</h4>
        <p>I prefer to have at least one initial call to make sure we're on the same page, but after that I'm happy to communicate entirely by email.</p>

        <h4>What's the difference between a website and a web application? Which one do I need?</h4>
        <p>This is a simplification, but to give you the basic idea:</p>
        <p>A website will always show you the same thing, no matter who is using it. For example, think of a site for a bookstore that shows the bookstore hours and location: no matter who is looking at the site, it's always going to show the store hours and location. It's a lot faster, simpler, and cheaper to create.</p>
        <p>Most small businesses only need a website.</p>
        <p>A web application changes depending on who is looking at it. Think of social media: when you sign in, you see your personalised feed. When someone else signs in, they see their own personalised feed. The site changes based on who is looking at it. These can take a lot longer to create, can be pretty simple or extremely complex, and generally need ongoing maintenance.</p>
        <p>Most businesses who need a web app hire full time software developers to build and maintain the web app - though there are exceptions!</p>
        <p>If you're not sure what you need, that's ok - we can discuss that on our initial call, and I can tell you what I think would work best for your business. The first step is to <a href="/index.html#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
