        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>These days, every business needs a web presence, but most don't have the time, resources, or know-how to make a site on their own. There's where I come in!</p>
        <p>I create fast, optimized, custom websites that fit your business needs. Get exactly what you need, whether that's a simple one page site or a complex web application.</p>
        <p>Price is set per project, so you'll know the full cost before agreeing to anything - no hidden fees! Depending on your project, you may pay <b>no</b> ongoing fees.</p>
        <p>Have questions? Check out the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> below.</p>
        <p>When you're ready to get started, the first step is to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me to discuss your project.</p>
        
        <h4>Why pay for a site when I can use a website builder?</h4>
        <p>This is the most common question I get! Website builders can work for some people, but there are some real disadvantages.</p>
        <p>The biggest disadvantage is price: most website builders have costly monthly fees that can add up quickly. I price per project, so you'll always know how much you're paying up front.</p>
        <p>Most website builders have limited options and have you select a premade style, with limited ways to change it. The websites I make are completely customized to you, so you get exactly what you want - no detail is too small to change.</p>
        <p>There's often a steep learning curve: it can take so long to figure out the software that it costs you more in time than you would have paid for a custom site. Adding extra features like scheduling or online store can get even more complicated, and mistakes can have a real financial impact on your business. And of course, something always seems to go wrong when you need to make an update in a hurry! I offer a retainer option that ensures I'll always have time to make a quick update for you.</p>
