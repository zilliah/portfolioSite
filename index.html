                <p>If you want reliable, friendly, and accessible support after your website is finished, there are two options available:</p>

                <h5>Retainer</h5>
                <p>A small monthly fee guarantees I'll always have an hour available for you each month.</p>
                <p>This is typically covers routine content updates, styling tweaks, etc.</p>
                <p>If larger updates are needed, you also get a discounted hourly rate and priority over non-retainer clients.</p>
                <p>This service is completely optional, and is available in 6 month increments. You can opt in at any time, even if I didn't create your website!</p>

                <h5>As Needed</h5>
                <p>If you don't anticipate needing regular support, you can reach out to me for support when you need it.</p>
                <p>I'm always happy to help, but it will be subject to my availability, and clients with a retainer are prioritised.</p>

            <p>I'm Kerry Smart, a web developer based near Ottawa, Ontario. I've been making websites on and off for the last ten years (among various other things). I particularly enjoy working with artists and small business owners.</p>
            <p>I also make <a href="https://kerrysm.art" target="_blank">pottery</a>, <a href="https://kerrrry.ca/gallery/" target="_blank">cross stitch</a>, and do <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verypuzzles/" target="_blank">puzzle reviews</a>. </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>TODO add some basics here</p>
        <p>eg: . info about ongoing support. free hosting limitations. cheapest site (make a form for this incl stripe payment). </p>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Why should I hire you when I can use a site builder?</h3>
            <p>Site builders can be useful tools, but they aren't for everyone. If a site builder works for you, that's great, but they do come with a lot of disadvantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Price:</b> most site builders charge a monthly fee, which adds up to a lot of money over time. When I make you a site, you pay once and it's yours forever. One-time fees have much less of an impact on your business.</li>
                <li><b>Customization:</b> a lot of website builders offer limited customization options, and you may be stuck using templates that don't work for you. With a custom website you can have it exactly how you want it.</li>
                <li><b>Ease of use:</b> even the easiest website builder comes with a learning curve, and more advanced builders can be almost as hard as writing code yourself. </li>
                <li><b>Time:</b> when you have a small business, it can feel like there just aren't enough hours in the day to get everything done. Creating and maintaining a website takes time</li>
                <li><b>Predictability:</b> things can change quickly on the internet, and there's no guarantee that your site builder will be around forever. If they go out of business abruptly or get bought out, you could lose your site entirely</li>
                <li><b>Security:</b> website builder typically collect private information and are often targeted by hackers (this is particularly common with Wordpress). A basic website has no information to steal. [TODO explain this better]</li>
                <li>accessibility (do site builders do this? how would you know?)</li>
                <li>customisation</li>
                <li>flexibility: change your mind and do other stuff later</li>
                <li>takes a lot of work to learn, spend a lot of time doing things</li>
                <li>i know what things matter</li>
                <li>optimised</li>
                <li>bloat (esp wordpress)</li>
                <li>support - it's just me, no weird phone system or people who don't know what's going on (or who've never seen your website) or frantic googling to find someone else who'd had the same problem</li>
            </ul>

                    <h4>Initial call</h4>
                    <p>We'll meet and discuss what you're looking for, including your timeline, your budget, and what you want on your site.</p>
                    <p>Typically this takes place over Zoom, but if you're in the Ottawa area I can come to you. If you hate meetings or are camera-shy, we can also talk over chat or email.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Proposal</h4>
                    <p>I'll create a project outline, including a mockup of the proposed site, a clear description of the features, and the price and schedule for the full project.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Planning</h4>
                    <p>We'll discuss what you're looking for, including your budget, timeline, and what you want on your site. We can meet in person if you live near Ottawa, over Zoom, or even do everything by email.</p>
                    <p>I'll create a project proposal with a basic mockup of the site, clear descriptions of everything to include, and price and deadline for the finished site.</p>
                    <p>You decide if this will work for you - no pressure to commit if it isn't what you're looking for!</p>
                    <p>If you're happy with the proposal, we'll both sign a project contract. The project contract puts everything in writing: the details of the site, the timeline, the price, etc. It explains who is responsible for what, and what will happen if anything changes.</p>

                    <h4>Site Launch</h4>
                    <p>When everything is complete and you're happy with the site, I'll launch it!</p>
                    <p>From there, the site is all yours! I'll transfer the site code and the hosting to you. [TODO do i transfer code or keep the repo? maybe send it all as a zip or sth, ppl don't want to mess w repos]</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Ongoing Support (Optional)</h4>
                    <p>If you choose, I offer an option for ongoing support: a regular fee guarantees some of my time set aside for you each month. This is totally optional, and you can opt out at any point.</p>
                    <p>I can update anything on your site, fix any technical issues you run into, redesign small details, etc.</p>

            <p>In addition to making websites, I offer <a href="https://kerrrry.ca/hire/" target="_blank">several other services</a>.</p>

            <p>I'm also open to bartering. This is entirely at my discretion - no promises! Right now I'm looking for ceramic kiln space, pottery wheel rental, pottery and voice lessons, and I'm always interested in art. I could also use some shelves.</p>
